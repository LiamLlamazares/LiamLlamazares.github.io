subtitle: Who's the wacko in charge of this blog?

Welcome traveler! It's pouring outside would you please step inside? Take a chair by the fire and make yourself comfortable. Ah! Where are my manners? Let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Liam, my undergraduate and master's studies were in Mathematics at the University of Salamanca and I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh.Â I had various great professors in these years who grew my interest in Analysis, PDEs, and more recently Stochastic Analysis. 
This blog will focus on these fields. If you're still interested, welcome to the team!

I'm a firm believer that to understand anything you have to make it your own, distill it to its essence and be capable of [re-explaining](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/) it in your own words and this blog will provide such a framework.
-  My posts will cover topics mostly in stochastics, analysis, and spatial statistics.
- Every post will contain a three-sentence summary where I hope to reduce the topic of the post to its essence.
- Furthermore, posts will have a *why should I care section?* (always a good question to ask) to place the information in context. 
- Finally, the finer workings of the topic (definitions, propositions, theorems, and examples) will be discussed in a way that focuses on the main ideas that make everything fit together and work. When proofs become very technical only the idea and some moderate details will be presented with references to primary sources cited.

## Ok but where do I as the reader fit in?
Good question! 
1. First of all I hope the presentation of the material is such that it provides a quick overview of topics while preserving the crucial information. As if you had an ally for an expedition through the jungle, helping you cut any vines, brambles, and snares that you may encounter.
2. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, I hope that, if this proposition has sparked your attention, you can engage in the topics and even contribute to the blog. Be it through comments on posts (which are extremely welcome!) and if you want you can contribute your own posts on any topic that catches your interest (manifolds, machine learning, algebraic geometry,...), who am I to judge? If you have something to teach we all have something to learn.

Please feel free to contact me through the comments or email (L.S.Llamazares-Elias@sms.ed.ac.uk), I'm very friendly and I don't bite :)
