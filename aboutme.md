Welcome traveler! It's pouring outside would you please step inside? Take a chair by the fire and make yourself comfortable. Ah! Where are my manners? Let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Liam, I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh. My undergraduate and masters studies were iin Mathematics at the University of Salamanca. I had various great professors in these years who shaped and grew my interest in analysis, PDE's and more recently Stochasatic Analysis. 
This blog will focus on these fields. If you're still interested, welcome to the team!

I'm a firm believer that to understand anything you have to make it your own, distill it to its essence and be capable of re-explaining it in you own words and this blog will provide such a framework.
- Posts will cover topics mostly in stochastics, analysis and spatial statistics.
- Every post will contain a three sentence summary where I hope to reduce the topic of the post to it's essence.
- Furthermore posts will have a *why should I care section?* (always a good question to ask) to place the information in context. 
- Finally the finer workings of the topic (definitions, propositions, theorems and examples) will be discussed in a way that focuses on the main ideas that make everything fit together and work. When proofs become very technical only the idea and some moderate details will be presented with references to primary sources cited.

## Ok but where do I as the reader fit in?
Good question! 
1. First of all I hope the presentation of the material is such that it provides a quick overview of topics while preserving the crucial information. Almost as if you had an ally through the jungle, helping you cut the vines, brambles and snares that you ay encounter.
2. Secondly and perhaps most importantly I hope that, if this proposition has sparked your attention, you can engage in the topics and even contribute to the blog. Be it through comments on posts (which are extremely welcome!) and if you want you can contribute your own posts on any topic that catches your interest (manifolds, machine learning, algebraic geometry,...), who am I to judge? If you have something to teach we both have something to learn.

Please deel free to contact me if interested, I'm very friendly and don't bite.
