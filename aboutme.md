subtitle: Who's the wacko in charge of this blog?

Welcome traveler! It's pouring outside would you please step inside? Take a chair by the fire and make yourself comfortable. Ah where are my manners, let me introduce myself. My name is Liam, I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh. My undergraduate and masters studies were iin Mathematics at the University of Salamanca. I had various great professors in these years who shaped and grew my interest in analysis, PDE's and more recently Stochasatic Analysis. 
This blog will focus on these fields. I'm a firm believer that to understand anything you have to make it your own, distill it to its essence and be capable of re-explaining it in you own words and this blog will provide such a framework.
- Posts will cover topics mostly in stochastics, analysis and spatial statistics.
- Every post will containa three sentence summary where I hope to reduce the topic of the post to it's essence.
- Furthermore posts will have a why should I care section to place the information in context. 
- Finally the finer workings of the topic (definitions, propositions, theorems and examples) will be discussed in a way that focuses on the main ideas that make everything fit together and work. When proofs becoe  technical only the idea and some moderate details will be presented with references to any omissions cited

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
