# Wiener Itô chaos expansion

## Three line summary

-   Square integrable *deterministic* functions of multiple variables
    can be repeatedly Itô integrated to get a square integrable *random*
    function.

-   Repeated integration satisfies an *isometry*.

-   Every square integrable function can be uniquely written as the
    *sum* of repeated integrals.

## Why this is important

I have no idea yet what this links to or why it's important. To be
filled out.2

## Iterated integrals

We will write $\mathcal{F}_t$ for the completion of the natural
filtration generated by $W(t)$, on some measure space $\Omega$ and
consider an interval $I=[0,T]$ or $I=[0,+\infty)$. We also recall the
notation
$$
\mathcal{M}_t^2:=\{f\in L^2([0,t]\times\Omega)\text{ that are continuous martingales}\}.
$$
