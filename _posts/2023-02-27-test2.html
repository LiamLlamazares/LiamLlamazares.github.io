title:  "How did I set up my blog using Jekyll, Hyde and GitHub"

What would be a better way to start this blog than writing a post about how I set it up? Because after three days of sifting through all the documents, blogs, StackOverflow answers and GitHub issues, I finally realized that the process is not as straightforward as I thought it would be. Anyway, I got it to work (for now).

My aim is simple, to set up a blog for myself where I can post stuff about my life. The blog needs to be free, elegant, intuitive and supports math. My current set up, Jekyll + Hyde + Github + MathJax, matches with that. Since there are many resources online about setting up a blog using Jekyll and serve it with GitHub, I am going to skip all the standard procedures by referring to the official documents. Instead, this post specifically documents:
- the sequence of setting up different parts,
- adding support for Tags, Categories and their corresponding pages,
- adding MathJax to support $\LaTeX$-like math.

I am using a macbook, so the steps will be described assuming the system is macOS. When in doubt, just google the relevant steps for other OSs.

## 1. Set up Jekyll
Jekyll is the package that is generating all your website pages. First thing you want to do is to make sure that [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is installed and ready to run.

## 5. Add MathJax

#### Tips
#### Math Rendering Showcase
- Inline math using `\$...\$`: $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}$.
- Displayed math using `\$\$...\$\$` on a new paragraph:

<div>
$$
\hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}_k (\alpha) = \alpha \hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}_k + (1-\alpha) \hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}} \,.
$$
</div>

In (\ref{eq:sample}), we find the value of an interesting integral:

<div>
$$
\begin{align}
  \int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15} \, .
  \label{eq:sample}
\end{align}
$$
</div>

- Multiline equations

<div>
$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} & = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \,,\newline
  \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \,.
\end{align*}
$$
</div>

That's it for now. Happy blogging.
