#  Three line summary

-   The Fourier transform defines a [linear isometry](https://nowheredifferentiable.com/2023-01-29-PDE-1/#derivativedistr:~:text=the%20following%20result.-,Proposition%204,-(Plancherel%E2%80%99s%20theorem).) on the space of
    square-integrable complex-valued functions and has as inverse the
    inverse Fourier transform. This allows us to write these
    functions as a [superposition of harmonic functions](https://nowheredifferentiable.com/2023-01-29-PDE-1/#derivativedistr:~:text=and%20where%20now-,Plancherel%E2%80%99s,-theorem%20gives%20that).

-   Linear differential operators act as a simple polynomial
    multiplication on the frequency domain. Smooth functions have
    Fourier transforms that decay quickly and [vice-versa](hhttps://nowheredifferentiable.com/2023-01-29-PDE-1/#:~:text=its%20inverse.%20The-,following,-proposition%20holds.). This
    correspondence also allows us to introduce fractional differential
    operators and pseudo differential operators such as
    [$\sqrt{-\Delta }$](https://nowheredifferentiable.com/2023-01-29-PDE-1/#derivativedistr:~:text=exercise-,Exercise,-1.%20How%20should).

-   The Sobolev spaces $H^s$ and tempered distributions $\mathcal{S}'$
    are complete spaces of functions to which we can [extend differential
    operators](https://nowheredifferentiable.com/2023-01-29-PDE-1/#derivativedistr:~:text=1-,and,-the%20(weak)).
