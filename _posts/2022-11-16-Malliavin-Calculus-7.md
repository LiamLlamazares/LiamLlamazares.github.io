#  Three line summary

-   There is a natural extension of the Laplacian to the Wiener space.

-   The generator of the Laplacian is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup.

-   The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup in finite dimensions is the
    generator of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, from which it derives
    its name.
