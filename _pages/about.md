I am a **Senior Research Associate** in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at **Lancaster University**. I work within the **EPSRC Hub in Probabilistic AI (ProbAI Hub)**, collaborating with Prof. [Chris Nemeth](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/chris-nemeth/) and Prof. [Paul Fearnhead](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/paul-fearnhead/).

Previously, I obtained my **PhD in Mathematical Modelling, Analysis and Computation** from the University of Edinburgh in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. [Finn Lindgren](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/professor-finn-lindgren) and Dr. [Jonas Latz](https://latzplacian.org). Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate and Master's degrees in Mathematics at the University of Salamanca.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **analysis** and **stochastics**, with a particular focus on:

- <i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** & **Stochastic PDEs**
- <i class="fas fa-route"></i> **Optimal Transport**
- <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> **Bayesian Inference**
- <i class="fas fa-search"></i> **Sampling as Optimization** (via gradient flows)

## Community

I organize the [**CSML (Computational Statistics and Machine Learning) Reading Group**](https://lu-csml.github.io/) at Lancaster University.

I also maintain a mathematics blog, [**nowheredifferentiable.com**](https://nowheredifferentiable.com), where I discuss topics I find interesting in analysis and stochastics.

## Personal

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy:

- **Sports**: Especially football and tennis.
- **Games**: Chess, board games (I will _never_ say no to a game of _Dune_), and Magic: The Gathering (reached global #2 on MTGA with my brother).
- **Reading**: Especially fantasy novels.
- **Languages**: Currently I enjoy learning Chinese.
