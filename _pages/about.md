I am a **Senior Research Associate** in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at **Lancaster University**. I work within the **EPSRC Hub in Probabilistic AI (ProbAI Hub)**, collaborating with [Prof. Chris Nemeth](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/chris-nemeth/) and [Prof. Paul Fearnhead](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/paul-fearnhead/). Previously, I obtained my **PhD in Mathematical Modelling, Analysis and Computation** from the University of Edinburgh in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Finn Lindgren and Dr. Jonas Latz. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate and Master's degrees in Mathematics at the University of Salamanca.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of analysis and stochastics. I focus on **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**, **Stochastic PDEs**, **Optimal Transport**, and **Bayesian Inference**.

I am particularly interested in viewing **sampling as an optimization problem** through the lens of **gradient flows**.

## Community & Personal

I organize the [**CSML (Computational Statistics and Machine Learning) Reading Group**](https://lu-csml.github.io/) at Lancaster University. I also maintain a mathematics blog, [**nowheredifferentiable**](nowheredifferentiable.com), where I discuss topics I find interesting in analysis and stochastics.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy playing football, tennis, chess and other board games (I will _never_ say no to a game of _Dune_). I also enjoy reading (especially fantasy) and learning languages, occasionally attempting both at once.
